This encrypted file system code was written in python 3.

To test the code open a terminal and type: python encfsStarterCode.py test/ mountpoint. This command is used to create the encrypted mountpoint directory with the contents of the test directory.

In another terminal to view the contents of the hello file type: cat moiuntpoint/hello

To add another file with new contents type: echo contents > mountpoint/newFile

The xxd command can be used to view information about a file in the encrypted file system.
